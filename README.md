# Meaningfully

Meaningfully is a semantic search tool for text data in spreadsheets. Keyword searching in Excel or Google Sheets is painful because text data is displayed awkwardly and keywords miss circumlocutions, typos, unexpected wording and foreign-language data. Semantic search solves all of that.

## Who is this for?

Journalists, researchers, academics, people who do surveys or solicit submissions, anybody.

## What is semantic search?

It's a middle-ground between AI chatbot search and keyword search. It uses the smarts of AI to 'understand' human language, but doesn't risk making stuff up like AI.

## My documents are PDFs, not spreadsheets. Can I use Meaningfully?

Try Semantra.

## Is Meaningfully free?

Sometimes. Semantic search requires "embedding" snippets of your document into numbers. You can do this on your computer, but it's very slow. That's free. You can also go get an OpenAI API key, put it into Meaningfully, and use that; you'll be responsible for the OpenAI charges, but Meaningfully doesn't cost any extra on top of that. (And it's generally very cheap. Most documents will cost a few pennies.)

Eventually, Meaningfully may include some paid options.
