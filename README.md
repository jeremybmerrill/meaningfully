# Meaningfully

Meaningfully is a semantic search tool for text data in spreadsheets. Keyword searching in Excel or Google Sheets is painful because text data is displayed awkwardly and keywords miss circumlocutions, typos, unexpected wording and foreign-language data. Semantic search solves all of that.

It's a middle-ground between AI chatbot search and keyword search. It uses the smarts of AI to 'understand' human language, but doesn't risk making stuff up like AI.
