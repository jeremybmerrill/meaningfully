        <h2>What is Semantic Search?</h2>
        <p>
            Keyword search has been the only kind of search for decades. Sometimes it fails:
        </p>

            <ol>
                <li>Typos</li>
                <li>Documents written by laypeople describing complex situations</li>
                <li>TK TK</li>
                <li>Multilingual documents</li>
            </ol>
        <p>
            Semantic search works better in these situations, by finding results that <i>mean</i> something
            similar to the query. Even if the words are completely different, semantic search can still
            surface the results you need.

        <h2>How should I write my query?</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Do: </strong> Imagine the perfect version of what you're looking for, that you wish exists in your spreadsheet. <span class="block whitespace-pre overflow-x-scroll">My car caught on fire as I was driving on the highway.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Don't: </strong> Just write keywords. <span class="block whitespace-pre overflow-x-scroll">crash OR fire OR aflame</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Don't: </strong> Ask a question, like you would to a chatbot. <span class="block whitespace-pre overflow-x-scroll">Please find me examples about cars catching on fire.</span>
        </p>

        <h2>How much does it cost?</h2>
        <p>
            Generally less than a dollar per document set, but you're paying OpenAI, not me, and you're responsible for all costs, no matter what.
        </p>
        <p>
            Eventually, some Meaningfully features may require payment.
